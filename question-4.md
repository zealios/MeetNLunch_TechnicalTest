Base from my reading and understanding I can suggest as following:

1. Compute Layer:
   - We can use AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for hosting web app and api. If require it easy to add/remove instance on demand.

2. Scalling and Load Distribution:
   - We can use AWS ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute traffic accross multiple EC2 instance and make it high availibility
   - To make it more cost effective we can use AWS Auto Scalling Group to automatically adjust EC2 instance according to current demand

3. Throttling and Traffic Management:
   - We can employ AWS API Gateway to manage the RESTful API services. It have built-in throttling capabilities to control traffic and avoid overload

4. Database and Data Access Layer:
   - We can reduce database cost by using AWS Aurora which give excelent read/write and it also have auto scalling built-in
   
5. Content Delivery and Global User Experience:
   - To improve user experience and content latency around the world we can use AWS CloudFront as content delivery network (CDN) to cache static content globally

6. Secure Mobile Access and User Synchronization:
   - To manage user authentication and sync across devices we can utilise AWS Cognito in web/mobile application

7. Self-healing Infrastructure and Fault Tolerance:
   - To ensure high availbility services we can use AWS Elastic Beanstalk which have capipability to handle infra management, monitoring and auto-recovery

8. Sentiment Analysis and Data Storage:
   - We can create AWS Lambda functions to capture and analysis sentiment data
   - For storage we can utilise AWS S3 and if the data already enter archive state we can use S3 lifecycle policies to automatically move inactive/old data to S3 Glacier and save a lot of storage cost in long run

9. Security of Data:
   - Make sure all communication between applocation, database and user using SSL/TLS
   - To manage encryption keys across application and services, we can use AWS KMS (Key Management Service)

10. Access Management:
    - For internal access to all AWS services we can manage it using AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) by defining roles and permissions for team member base o their responsibility as the team grows

11. Source Code Management and Deployment Automation:
    - Internally we can use AWS CodeCommit for source code management, AWS CodeBuild for automated builds, and AWS CodePipeline for continuous integration and deployment. With these we can streamlined and automated approach to source code management, testing, and deployment.

12. Managing Multiple Environments:
    - To ensure consistentcy and reproducible deployment for different application/service stage we can use AWS CloudFormation or Elastic Beanstalk's environment management feature to replicate base on blueprint

By using all services offer by AWS, the startup can standardize their architecture and work flow that ensure secure, scalable, high-performance, efficient, elastic, highly available, fault-tolerant, and recoverable solution that support company rapid growth. Using AWS also can help company find good talent since there are a lot of trainning and certification for AWS services.
